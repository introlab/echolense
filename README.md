EchoLense is an open-source acoustic camera made by [IntRoLab](https://introlab.3it.usherbrooke.ca/mediawiki-introlab/index.php/Main_Page). It aims to provide a flexible platform to the scientific community to further research in the field. It can be built with common off-the-shelf components and a 3D printer, so it's pretty accessible and that's the goal! You'll find everything you need in this repo to build one yourself. If you encounter a problem or have a suggestion for us, feel free to open an issue!
